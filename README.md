# gaiaEDR3_pulsars

Here we present the code to reproduce the results in Moran, Mingarelli, Bedell, and Good. Please cite our paper when you use this code. 

We examine the binary companions to IPTA pulsars using Gaia EDR3. In doing so we hope to improve distance measurments to the MSPs which can in turn improve gravitational wave detection, dark matter measurements, and tests of general relativity. 

To conduct the cross match, see ChiaraMingarelli's gaia_xmatch.
